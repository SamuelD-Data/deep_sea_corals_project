"This dataset contains information about deep sea corals and sponges collected by NOAA and NOAAâ€™s partners. Amongst the data are geo locations of deep sea corals and sponges and the whole thing is tailored to the occurrences of azooxanthellates - a subset of all corals and all sponge species (i.e. they don't have symbiotic relationships with certain microbes). Additionally, these records only consists of observations deeper than 50 meters to truly focus on the deep sea corals and sponges." [Source](https://www.kaggle.com/noaa/deep-sea-corals)
